## 3D Model Metadata ##

This is an informal set of metadata for a 3D model produced via the MicroPasts crowdsourcing web platform (http://crowdsourced.micropasts.org).

### General Information ###

This object (maryrose-angel) is a bone plaque carving recovered from inside a chest found on the Main Deck of the Mary Rose (sunk 1545, raised 1982). It depicts two angels in profile walking in a procession to the right each carrying a candle.

It is similar to plaques made for triptychs in the Northern Italian workshops of the Embriachi family (late 14th and early 15 Century). They produced a variety of luxury objects (mirrors, caskets and triptychs) incorporating a series of bone or ivory plaques.Triptychs, often used as altar pieces or for private prayer, displayed scenes of a religious nature.
