## 3D Model Metadata ##

This is an informal set of metadata for a 3D model produced via the MicroPasts crowdsourcing web platform (http://crowdsourced.micropasts.org).

### General Information ###

This object (maryrose-bowl) is a beech wooden bowl. In total, over 60 bowls were raised during the excavations on board the Mary Rose (sunk 1545, raised 1982). This is one of 30 beech bowls recovered. The bowl was manufactured on a pole lathe from a section of timber. Some of the circular grooves from this method of manufacture can clearly be seen.

The bowls were recovered from all over the ship. Smaller ones are thought to be drinking bowls and many bear crude marks scored into the wood. This bowl has a complex series of linear marks and initials on the inside and outside, thought to denote ownership.

### Available Data ###

We have created three models: a textured mesh with 100k faces, another with 300k faces, and the original dense point cloud. The raw images, image masks and exported information about camera position and alignment markers are also available.
