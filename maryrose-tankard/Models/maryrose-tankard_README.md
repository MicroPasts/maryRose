## 3D Model Metadata ##

This is an informal set of metadata for a 3D model produced via the MicroPasts crowdsourcing web platform (http://crowdsourced.micropasts.org).

### General Information ###

This object (maryrose-tankard) is a wooden tankard. The staved wooden vessels recovered from the Mary Rose (sunk 1545, raised 1982) of which this wooden drinking tankard was one, provide the largest assemblage of domestic wooden vessels yet recovered in the British Isles.

Made from seven staves and held together with hoops, this tankard also retained much of the pitch lining that made it watertight. Oak, poplar, pine, beech and willow were all used in its construction. A small “X” shaped mark can clearly be seen on the lid and this is probably a mark to indicate ownership.


### Available Data ###

We have created three models: a textured mesh with 100k faces, another with 300k faces, and the original dense point cloud. The raw images, image masks and exported information about camera position and alignment markers are also available.
